The BMVC 2023 organising committee, in association with the Scottish Informatics & Computer Science Alliance (SICSA), is delighted to offer a limited number of grants to support students’ attendance to the conference. These grants are designed to support students who would normally find it difficult to attend conferences. Those grants are exclusively reserved for postgraduate students. Postdocs, faculty and other research personnel are not eligible to apply. A total of 16 grants covering accommodation costs and conference fees will be awarded, 7 of them reserved for students at Scottish universities.  

We will support in priority applicants who: 

- have no other support means for attending the conference; 
- are first authors on their paper; 
- are attending an international conference for the first time; 
- can confirm they have the means to cover their transport costs to the conference from other means.  

We particularly encourage minorities, women or students at the beginning of their PhD to apply!  

You should submit the application via the following form **before 15th of October 2023, 23:59 pm (hard deadline)**. 

**Decisions will be communicated a week afterwards.**
