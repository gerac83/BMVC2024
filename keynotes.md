				<b>Bio: </b>Maja Pantic obtained her PhD degree in computer science in 2001 from Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. Until 2005, she was an Assistant/ Associate Professor at Delft University of Technology. In 2006, she joined the Imperial College London, Department of Computing, UK, where she is Professor of Affective & Behavioural Computing and the Head of the iBUG group, working on machine analysis of human non-verbal behaviour. From April 2018 to April 2020, she was the Research Director of Samsung AI Research Centre in Cambridge. In April 2020, she joined Facebook as an AI Scientific Research Lead in Facebook London. Prof. Pantic is one of the world's leading experts in the research on machine understanding of human behavior including vision-based detection, tracking, and analysis of human behavioral cues like facial expressions and body gestures, and multimodal analysis of human behaviors like laughter, social signals, and affective states.  Prof. Pantic received various awards for her work including BCS Roger Needham Award, awarded annually to a UK based researcher for a distinguished research contribution in computer science, and IAPR Maria Petrou Award, awarded biannually to a living female scientist for her contributions to the field of Pattern Recognition. She is a Fellow of the UK's Royal Academy of Engineering, an IEEE Fellow and an IAPR Fellow.</p>

				<b>Bio: </b>Daniel Cremers received Bachelor degrees in Mathematics (1994) and Physics (1994), and a Master's degree in Theoretical Physics (1997) from the University of Heidelberg. In 2002 he obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Mannheim, Germany. Subsequently he spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and one year as a permanent researcher at Siemens Corporate Research in Princeton, NJ. From 2005 until 2009 he was associate professor at the University of Bonn, Germany. Since 2009 he holds the Chair of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence at the Technical University of Munich. His publications received several awards, including the 'Best Paper of the Year 2003' (Int. Pattern Recognition Society), the 'Olympus Award 2004' (now called 'German Pattern Recognition Award') and the '2005 UCLA Chancellor's Award for Postdoctoral Research'. For pioneering research he received a Starting Grant (2009), two Proof of Concept Grants (2014 & 2018), a Consolidator Grant (2015) and an Advanced Grant (2020) by the European Research Council. Professor Cremers has served as associate editor for several journals including the International Journal of Computer Vision, the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence and the SIAM Journal of Imaging Sciences. He has served as area chair (associate editor) for ICCV, ECCV, CVPR, ACCV, IROS, etc, and as program chair for ACCV 2014. In 2018 he organized the largest ever European Conference on Computer Vision in Munich with 3300 delegates. He is member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He is honorary member of the Dagstuhl Scientific Directorate. In December 2010 he was listed among "Germany's top 40 researchers below 40" (Capital). On March 1st 2016, Prof. Cremers received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Award, the biggest award in German academia. According to Google Scholar, Prof. Cremers has an h-index of 112 and his papers have been cited 59818 times. According to Guide2Research he is among the most influential computer scientists in Germany. In April 2022, he was listed among the top 10 most influential scholars in robotics of the last decade. He is co-founder of several companies, most recently the high-tech startup Artisense.</p>
