The British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) is one of the major international conferences on computer vision and related areas. It is organised by the British Machine Vision Association (BMVA). The 35th BMVC will now be an **in-person** event from 25thâ€”28th November 2024 in Glasgow, UK. 

Authors are invited to submit high-quality papers in image processing, computer vision, machine learning and related areas for BMVC 2023. Submitted papers will be refereed on originality, presentation, empirical results, and evaluation quality. Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings published and DOI-indexed by BMVA. Past proceedings are online at the [BMVA proceedings website](https://britishmachinevisionassociation.github.io/bmvc).

Please note that BMVC is a single-track meeting with oral and poster presentations. **The paper submission deadline will be on the 3rd of May 2024**. Submitted papers should not exceed <b>NINE</b> pages (references are excluded), and appendices should be submitted via the supplementary information. 

The submission portal will be available from the 1st of April, 2024.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- 2D object recognition
- 3D computer vision 
- 3D object recognition
- Action and behaviour recognition 
- Adversarial learning, adversarial attack and defence methods
- Biometrics, face, gesture, body pose
- Computational photography
- Datasets and evaluation 
- Document Image Analysis
- Efficient training and inference methods for networks 
- Embodied vision: Active agents, simulation
- Explainable AI, fairness, accountability, privacy, transparency and ethics in vision 
- Image and video retrieval 
- Image and video synthesis
- Image classification
- Low-level and physics-based vision 
- Machine learning architectures and formulations 
- Medical, biological and cell microscopy 
- Motion and tracking 
- Optimisation and learning methods 
- Pose estimation
- Privacy and Ethics in Vision
- Representation learning
- Scene analysis and understanding 
- Transfer, low-shot, semi- and un- supervised learning 
- Video analysis and understanding 
- Vision + language, vision + other modalities 
- Vision applications and systems
- Vision for robotics and autonomous vehicles
- Vision for Sustainable Practices
- "Brave new ideas"

Papers submitted under the "Brave new ideas" subject area are expected to move away from incremental benchmark gains. Proposed ideas should radically differ from the current research strand or propose a novel problem.

### Reviewing Process for BMVC 2024

- Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. The Area Chair will provide a meta-review, summarising the reviewers' points and recommending paper decisions.

- The authors will have a period to produce a rebuttal to address the reviewers' points. Authors with papers accepted will need to incorporate reviewers' suggestions before the final camera-ready submission.

- The rebuttal will be handled by only by one Area Chair who will facilitate paper discussion between reviewers and request reviewers to clarify or revise their review. Conflicts will be managed by the ACs and Programme Chairs.

**Please Note:** Due to the anticipated volume of papers for BMVC 2024 (based on recent year's experience), there will be NO extension granted to the submission deadline. In keeping with conferences in the field (e.g., [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc), [CVPR](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com)) and to cope with the increasing number of submissions, we ask that all authors be prepared to review papers. The submission site will ask authors to acknowledge this commitment, and failure to engage with the reviewing process might be grounds for rejection.

Any queries to the Programme Chairs should be sent to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}"> {{ site.email }}</a>.
