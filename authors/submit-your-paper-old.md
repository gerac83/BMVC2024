<p>Paper submission and registration are handled via OpenReview. The submission portal will open on April 2nd, 2024. Further instructions will be posted here in due course.</p>

<!-- Paper registration is performed by registering as a user with OpenReview and entering a paper title and abstract. This will result in the allocation of a “paper ID”, which indicates registration is completed and should be used in preparation of the review copy. You will be able to make edits and upload new paper drafts until the final deadline. Submitted papers should be prepared according to the published specification for formatting and style. Please be sure to read both the formatting instructions and policies before submission. -->

<h3>Formatting your paper</h3>

A complete paper should be submitted according to the formatting style ([please see below under typesetting]({{site.baseurl}}{% link authors/submit-your-paper.md %}#typesetting)). 

### Submitted paper (for review)

Papers submitted for review should be anonymous and instead include the paper ID as allocated by OpenReview upon registration of the abstract/paper. The addition of line numbers (automatic in the PDFLaTeX template) should be included, in order to facilitate the review process.

**Page limit:** A complete paper should be submitted according to the [formatting style]({{site.baseurl}}{% link authors/submit-your-paper.md %}#typesetting). **The length of papers submitted for review should not exceed NINE pages excluding the references.** All appendices must be supplied as supplementary material and do not count towards the NINE pages limit. 

### Paper policies

We invite authors to familiarise temselves with the <a title="Author guidelines policy" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link authors/faq.md %}">FAQ</a> before submitting a paper to BMVC. Below, you can find a brief summary of the main points of this policy.

<h3>Dual submission</h3>

<p> The BMVC conference aims to publish new and exciting research while avoiding duplicating previously published work. When authors submit a manuscript, they acknowledge that it has not been previously published or accepted for publication in any peer-reviewed venue, including journals, conferences, workshops, or other archives. They also agree not to submit substantially similar content to any other venue during the review period. The definition of a publication for this policy is a written work longer than four pages that was reviewed by peers and accepted. ArXiv preprints and university technical reports are not considered publications, but peer-reviewed workshop papers are. Technical reports that are not peer-reviewed are not considered prior art and do not need to be cited in the submission.</p>

Please see the <a title="Author guidelines" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link authors/faq.md %}">FAQ</a> for further details.</p>

<!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" href="{{site.baseurl}}{% link authors/faq.md %}">Please check the FAQ</a></p> -->

<h3>Author&#8217;s responsibilities</h3>

**MAY REMOVE THIS**

<p>If there are papers that may appear to violate any of these conditions, it is the authors’ responsibility to</p>

<ol>
<li>Cite these papers (preserving anonymity)</li>
<li>Argue in the body of your paper why your BMVC paper is non trivially different from these concurrent submissions</li>
<li>Include anonymised versions of those papers in the supplemental material</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conflict responsibilities:</strong> It is the primary author's responsibility to ensure that <strong>all authors</strong> on their paper have registered on CMT and entered their institutional domain conflicts into the CMT system. If a paper is found to have an undeclared or incorrect institutional conflict, the paper may be summarily rejected. <strong>To avoid undeclared conflicts, the author list is considered to be final after the submission deadline and no changes are allowed for accepted papers.</strong> If you are uncertain of how to enter domain conflicts please see the entry on the <a title="FAQ" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link authors/faq.md %}">FAQ</a>.
</p>



<!--<p><strong>Entering Domain Conflicts:</strong></p>-->




<p><strong> Double-blind review:</strong> The reviewing process for BMVC is double-blind (in keeping with the standard for international computer vision conferences). 
This means that authors do not know the names of the area chair/reviewers of their papers, and the area chairs/reviewers cannot, beyond reasonable doubt, infer the names of the authors from the submission and the additional material. To this end please:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgements (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g., titles in the movies, or attached papers)</li>
<li>Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors</li>
<li>Avoid direct promotion (e.g., press release or social media) of the paper to the public that would seek to inform potential reviewers of the authors (please see the <a title="FAQ" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link authors/faq.md %}">FAQ</a> for further clarification)</li>
</ul>

<p>Violation of any of these guidelines may lead to rejection without review. If you need to cite a different paper of yours that is being submitted concurrently to BMVC, the authors should (1) cite these papers; (2) argue in the body of your paper why your paper is non trivially different from these concurrent submissions; and (3) include anonymised versions of those papers in the supplemental material. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Availability for review:</strong> As per the call for papers, in keeping with conferences in the field (e.g., <a href="https://medium.com/@NeurIPSConf/getting-started-with-neurips-2020-e350f9b39c28">NeurIPS</a>) and to cope with the increasing number of submissions, we ask that all authors be prepared to review papers. The OpenReview submission site will ask authors to acknowledge this commitment and failure to engage with the reviewing process might be grounds for rejection.
</p>
<p>
Our expectation is that the majority of authors should make themselves available as reviewers. At the time of abstract submission on OpenReview, the author list should be entered on the platform and an option will be available for authors to indicate which authors will be able to review - requests for certain authors to not be considered as reviewers can also be entered with a suitable justification. For example, junior researchers (e.g., early PhD and below) or authors who are not computer vision researchers (e.g., providing domain expertise for experiments) would be considered reasonable justification.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Publicity, social media:</strong> Papers submitted to BMVC should not be discussed with the press until they have been officially accepted for publication. Work explicitly identified as a BMVC submission also may not be advertised on social media. Please see the <a title="FAQ" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link authors/faq.md %}">FAQ</a> for more details. Violations may result in the paper being rejected or removed from the conference and proceedings.
</p>



<p>
<strong>FAQ:</strong> Further details and answers to additional questions are available on the author <a title="FAQ" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link authors/faq.md %}">FAQ</a> page.
</p>

### Typesetting

<p>Typesetting should be done using the <strong>PDFLaTeX system</strong> (part of all modern LaTeX distributions). However, in exceptional circumstances, submissions prepared in Microsoft Word or OpenOffice may be accepted but it is the authors' responsibility to use the template appropriately and match as closely to the PDFLaTeX system as possible. </p>

<p>Paper templates, along with example PDF outputs are available for download through GitHub: </p>

<div class="row no-gutters pt-0 d-xs-block ">
    <div class="mb-1 pl-2 pr-2 mx-auto mx-sm-left col-xs-auto">
        <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" href="https://github.com/BMVC2023/BMVCTemplate/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">Download the template</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-1 pl-2 pr-2 mx-auto mx-sm-left col-xs-auto">
        <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" href="https://github.com/BMVC2023/BMVCTemplate">View the Github repository</a></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Instructions on how to use the BMVC LaTeX template are described in the README.md file within the repository. To enable review mode in the LaTeX template, the <code>\bmvcreviewcopy{??}</code> command should be used, where <code>??</code> is your assigned paper number.</p>

<p><strong>For the camera ready copy</strong>, the <code>\bmvcreviewcopy{??}</code> command should be removed. Also, remember to de-anonymise, have the same order and number of authors as stated in the CMT submission, and that you can add an extra page of content to the camera ready version of your paper.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Supplementary material</h3>

<p>Authors may optionally upload supplementary material, which may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Videos to showcase results/demo of the proposed approach/system</li>
<li>Images and other results in addition to the ones in the paper</li>
<li>Anonymised related submissions to other conferences and journals</li>
<li>Appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical derivations that are not essential to the understanding of the submitted paper</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Supplementary material should be uploaded as a single ZIP file (up to 100MB) to the OpenReview website.</strong></p>

The authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material appropriately in the paper. Note that reviewers will be encouraged to look at it, but are not obligated to do so. 

<!--
Supplementary material is to be submitted by the [supplemental material deadline]({{site.baseurl}}{% link dates.md %}).
