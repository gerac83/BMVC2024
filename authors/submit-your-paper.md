## Author Guidelines

We invite authors to familiarise themselves with the Author Guidelines before submitting a paper to BMVC. **PCs will reject a paper if the paper and authors do not adhere to these guidelines.**
<!-- Below, you can find a summary of the main points of this policy. -->

**Author Guidelines will be available from April 1st, 2024.**

## Formatting your paper

A complete paper should be submitted according to the formatting style ([please see below under typesetting]({{site.baseurl}}{% link authors/submit-your-paper.md %}#typesetting)). 

#### Submitted paper (for review)

Papers submitted for review should be anonymous and instead include the paper ID allocated by OpenReview upon registration of the abstract/paper. The addition of line numbers (automatic in the PDFLaTeX template) should be included to facilitate the review process.

**Page limit:** A complete paper should be submitted according to the [formatting style]({{site.baseurl}}{% link authors/submit-your-paper.md %}#typesetting). **The length of papers submitted for review should not exceed NINE pages, excluding the references.** All appendices must be supplied as supplementary material and do not count towards the NINE pages limit. 

#### Typesetting

<p>Typesetting should be done using the <strong>PDFLaTeX system</strong> (part of all modern LaTeX distributions). However, submissions prepared in Microsoft Word or OpenOffice may be accepted in exceptional circumstances. Still, it is the authors' responsibility to match their paper to the PDFLaTeX system. </p>

<p>Paper templates, along with example PDF outputs, are available for download through GitHub: </p>

<div class="row no-gutters pt-0 d-xs-block ">
    <div class="mb-1 pl-2 pr-2 mx-auto mx-sm-left col-xs-auto">
        <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" href="https://github.com/BMVC2023/BMVCTemplate/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">Download the template</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-1 pl-2 pr-2 mx-auto mx-sm-left col-xs-auto">
        <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" href="https://github.com/BMVC2023/BMVCTemplate">View the Github repository</a></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Instructions on how to use the BMVC LaTeX template are described in the README.md file within the repository. To enable review mode in the LaTeX template, the <code>\bmvcreviewcopy{??}</code> command should be used, where <code>??</code> is your assigned paper number.</p>

<p><strong>For the camera ready copy</strong>, the <code>\bmvcreviewcopy{??}</code> command should be removed. Also, remember to de-anonymise, have the same order and number of authors as stated in the CMT submission, and you can add an extra page of content to the camera-ready version of your paper.</p>

<p></p>

#### Supplementary material

<p>Authors may optionally upload supplementary material, which may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Videos to showcase results/demo of the proposed approach/system</li>
<li>Images and other results in addition to the ones in the paper</li>
<li>Anonymised related submissions to other conferences and journals</li>
<li>Appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical derivations that are not essential to the understanding of the submitted paper</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Supplementary material should be uploaded as a single ZIP file (up to 100MB) to the OpenReview website.</strong></p>

The authors should appropriately refer to the supplementary material in the paper. Note that reviewers will be encouraged to look at it but are not obligated to do so. 

Supplementary material is to be submitted by the [supplemental material deadline]({{site.baseurl}}{% link dates.md %}).

## Paper Submission

<p>Paper submission and registration are handled via OpenReview. The submission portal will open on April 1st, 2024. Further instructions will be posted here in due course.</p>

<!-- Paper registration is performed by registering as a user with OpenReview and entering a paper title and abstract. This will result in the allocation of a “paper ID”, which indicates that registration is completed and should be used to prepare the review copy. You can make edits and upload new paper drafts until the final deadline. Submitted papers should be prepared according to the published specifications for formatting and style. Please be sure to read both the formatting instructions and policies before submission. -->
