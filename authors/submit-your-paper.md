<p><strong>The submission system for {{site.short-title}} papers is open at:</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><a href="{{site.cmt-url}}">{{site.cmt-url}}</a></strong></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

<!-- <p>Please refer to the <a href="../../workshops/index.html">workshops page</a> for workshop paper submission instructions.</p> -->


<p>Paper submission and registration are handled via the Conference Management Toolkit (CMT). Paper registration is performed by registering as a user with CMT and entering a paper title and abstract. This will result in the allocation of a “paper ID”, which indicates registration is completed and should be used in preparation of the review copy. You will be able to make edits and upload new paper drafts until the final deadline. Submitted papers should be prepared according to the published specification for formatting and style. Please be sure to read both the formatting instructions and policies before submission.</p>

<h3>Formatting your paper</h3>

A complete paper should be submitted in according to the formatting style ([please see below under typesetting]({{site.baseurl}}{% link authors/submit-your-paper.md %}#typesetting)). 

### Submitted paper (for review)

Papers submitted for review should be anonymous and instead include the paper ID as allocated by CMT upon registration of the paper. The addition of line numbers (automatic in the PDFLaTeX template) should be included, in order to facilitate the review process.

**Page limit:** A complete paper should be submitted in according to the [formatting style]({{site.baseurl}}{% link authors/submit-your-paper.md %}#typesetting). **The length of papers submitted for stage one review should not exceed NINE pages excluding the references.** All appendices must be counted within the nine-page limit or supplied as supplementary material. 

### Paper policies

By submitting a manuscript to BMVC, the authors guarantee that it has not been previously published (or accepted for publication) in substantially similar form. Furthermore, no paper which contains significant overlap with the contributions of this paper either is under review at the moment of submission or will be submitted during the {{short-title}} review period to any of the following: another conference, a workshop, or a journal. The authors also attest that they did not submit substantially similar submissions to {{site.short-title}}. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection.

<h3>Dual submission</h3>

<p>A publication, for the purposes of this policy, is defined to be a written work longer than four pages (excluding references) that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, was accepted and appeared in a formal proceedings. This definition does not consider an arXiv.org or university technical report as a publication. Please see the entry on the <a title="FAQ" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link authors/faq.md %}">FAQ</a> for further details.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" href="{{site.baseurl}}{% link authors/faq.md %}">Please check the FAQ</a></p>

<h3>Author&#8217;s responsibilities</h3>

<p>If there are papers that may appear to violate any of these conditions, it is the authors’ responsibility to</p>

<ol>
<li>Cite these papers (preserving anonymity)</li>
<li>Argue in the body of your paper why your BMVC paper is non trivially different from these concurrent submissions</li>
<li>Include anonymised versions of those papers in the supplemental material</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conflict responsibilities:</strong> It is the primary author's responsibility to ensure that <strong>all authors</strong> on their paper have registered on CMT and entered their institutional domain conflicts into the CMT system. If a paper is found to have an undeclared or incorrect institutional conflict, the paper may be summarily rejected. <strong>To avoid undeclared conflicts, the author list is considered to be final after the submission deadline and no changes are allowed for accepted papers.</strong> If you are uncertain of how to enter domain conflicts please see the entry on the <a title="FAQ" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link authors/faq.md %}">FAQ</a>.
</p>



<!--<p><strong>Entering Domain Conflicts:</strong></p>-->




<p><strong> Double-blind review:</strong> The reviewing process for BMVC is double-blind (in keeping with the standard for international computer vision conferences). 
This means that authors do not know the names of the area chair/reviewers of their papers, and the area chairs/reviewers cannot, beyond reasonable doubt, infer the names of the authors from the submission and the additional material. To this end please:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgements (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g., titles in the movies, or attached papers)</li>
<li>Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors</li>
<li>Avoid direct promotion (e.g., press release or social media) of the paper to the public that would seek to inform potential reviewers of the authors (please see the <a title="FAQ" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link authors/faq.md %}">FAQ</a> for further clarification)</li>
</ul>

<p>Violation of any of these guidelines may lead to rejection without review. If you need to cite a different paper of yours that is being submitted concurrently to BMVC, the authors should (1) cite these papers; (2) argue in the body of your paper why your paper is non trivially different from these concurrent submissions; and (3) include anonymised versions of those papers in the supplemental material. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Availability for review:</strong> As per the call for papers, in keeping with conferences in the field (e.g., <a href="https://medium.com/@NeurIPSConf/getting-started-with-neurips-2020-e350f9b39c28">NeurIPS</a>) and to cope with the increasing number of submissions, we ask that all authors be prepared to review papers. The CMT submission site will ask authors to acknowledge this commitment and failure to engage with the reviewing process might be grounds for rejection.
</p>
<p>
Our expectation is that the majority of authors should make themselves available as reviewers. At the time of abstract submission on CMT, the author list should be entered on CMT and an option will be available for authors to indicate which authors will be able to review - requests for certain authors to not be considered as reviewers can also be entered with a suitable justification. For example, junior researchers (e.g., early PhD and below) or authors who are not computer vision researchers (e.g., providing domain expertise for experiments) would be considered reasonable justification.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Publicity, social media:</strong> Papers submitted to BMVC should not be discussed with the press until they have been officially accepted for publication. Work explicitly identified as a BMVC submission also may not be advertised on social media. Please see the <a title="FAQ" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link authors/faq.md %}">FAQ</a> for more details. Violations may result in the paper being rejected or removed from the conference and proceedings.
</p>

<strong>FAQ:</strong> Further details and answers to additional questions are available on the author <a title="FAQ" href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link authors/faq.md %}">FAQ</a> page.
</p>

### Typesetting

<p>Typesetting should be done using the <strong>PDFLaTeX system</strong> (part of all modern LaTeX distributions). However, in exceptional circumstances, submissions prepared in Microsoft Word or OpenOffice may be accepted but it is the authors' responsibility to use the template appropriately and match as closely to the PDFLaTeX system as possible. </p>

<p>Paper templates, along with example PDF outputs are available for download through GitHub: </p>

<div class="row no-gutters pt-0 d-xs-block ">
    <div class="mb-1 pl-2 pr-2 mx-auto mx-sm-left col-xs-auto">
        <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" href="https://github.com/BMVC2023/BMVCTemplate/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">Download the template</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-1 pl-2 pr-2 mx-auto mx-sm-left col-xs-auto">
        <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" href="https://github.com/BMVC2023/BMVCTemplate">View the Github repository</a></p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Instructions on how to use the BMVC LaTeX template are described in the README.md file within the repository. To enable review mode in the LaTeX template, the <code>\bmvcreviewcopy{??}</code> command should be used, where <code>??</code> is your assigned paper number.</p>

<p><strong>For the camera ready copy</strong>, the <code>\bmvcreviewcopy{??}</code> command should be removed. Also, remember to de-anonymise, have the same order and number of authors as stated in the CMT submission, and that you can add an extra page of content to the camera ready version of your paper.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Supplementary material</h3>

<p>Authors may optionally upload supplementary material, which may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Videos to showcase results/demo of the proposed approach/system</li>
<li>Images and other results in addition to the ones in the paper</li>
<li> Anonymised related submissions to other conferences and journals</li>
<li>Appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical derivations that are not essential to the understanding of the submitted paper</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Supplementary material should be uploaded as a single ZIP file (up to 100MB) to the CMT website.</strong></p>

The authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material appropriately in the paper. Note that reviewers will be encouraged to look at it, but are not obligated to do so. 

<!--
Supplementary material is to be submitted by the [supplemental material deadline]({{site.baseurl}}{% link dates.md %}).
