The following provides details on how to upload video presentations for your BMVC 2020 papers for authors of papers accepted for both oral and poster presentation. The deadline for uploading videos is 23:59 BST on August 20th.

## Videos

We will not have a separate short 1-2 minute spotlight video i.e. there is only one video per paper. Instead, authors of papers accepted as posters are strongly encouraged to spend the first 1 minute of the video doing a high level overview of the paper followed by a more in-depth presentation of the work. Oral presenters should not follow this format. Poster authors can choose the total duration of the video up to the maximum length of 10 minutes. Oral presenters are strongly encouraged to make their videos 10 minutes long - the video will be streamed as part of an oral session as well as hosted on the website.

## Uploading your videos

We will be using [SlidesLive](https://slideslive.com) for hosting and streaming the videos for BMVC 2020. This is the same service used by ICML 2020 and ICLR 2020. For BMVC 2020 the final videos will be presented in a very similar way to these conferences - you can see some examples on the [ICLR 2020 website](https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/papers.html).
SlidesLive provides an in-browser recording tool (you will get the upload link in a separate email). This tool captures both a presenter view (from your webcam) and your slides. If there are animations in your slides these will also be captured (see example at 20 seconds [here](https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/poster_HkxYzANYDB.html)). We strongly encourage you to use this tool for your videos. However, it is possible for you to upload your own videos should you wish too, but you still need to abide by the 10 minute duration limit. Videos should be 1920x1080p using H264 compression.

## Tips for presenting

* SlidesLive have some [tips on how to capture good recordings](http://slideslive.com/recording-tips)
* Ensure the recording space is quiet and without distractions. For best results, use a microphone or present close to your laptop microphone
* You can find inspiration in some of the presentation videos for CVPR 2020 [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0n76gicaarsN_Y9YShWwhw/videos) (note that this list is a mix of workshop, oral, and spotlight videos)

## Paper Registration

All papers will require one author to pay an event enabling registration fee (that we are seeking to keep as low as possible and should be < 120 GBP per paper to cover the costs of hosting and streaming the conference and all the videos) for the conference and to attend the interactive presentations (poster or oral). We will send round details to all authors next week. [Please note that we will require one fee per paper in the case of authors of multiple papers]. We will be providing details on additional registrations shortly - our hope is that this will allow us to keep a low general registration fee to enable the maximum participation from the vision community and make sure all the papers can be disseminated as widely as possible.
