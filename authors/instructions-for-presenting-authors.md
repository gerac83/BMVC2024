## Posters

All authors with accepted papers at BMVC 2024 will have the opportunity to present their work in one of the poster sessions (including oral presentations). For this, we ask that the e-poster image to be a non-transparent .pdf file that is at least 1000 X 6000 px, A0 aspect ratio and no larger than 3 MB. Posters should be in portrait. 

For the conference, please prepare a physical poster in A0 size (841 x 1188 mm) in portrait to fit our poster boards. Details for the poster schedule can be found in the [conference schedule](https://bmvc2024.org/programme/programme/). We have no official template for your e-poster or video, but we would suggest you include our BMVC 2024 logo which can be downloaded from [https://bmvc2024.org](https://bmvc2024.org).


**We will not have facilities to print posters, so participants are asked to bring their posters to the sign-in desk when registering on-site, and a volunteer team member will set up the poster.**

## Video summaries

Authors of papers accepted as orals and posters are strongly encouraged to prepare a video summary of the paper. We recommend spending the first 1 minute of the video doing a high-level overview of the paper followed by a more in-depth presentation of the work. Authors can choose the total duration of the video up to the maximum length of 3 minutes. Videos should be

* 1920x1080p,
* less than 20 Mb; and,
* MP4.

Please note that the video presentation will be publicly available in the conference proceedings. If you are uncomfortable showing your face to the public, please do not record your face during the video presentation.

## Uploading your e-poster and videos

Videos can be uploaded via OpenReview; similar to uploading your camera-ready paper. For this, we have a new submission to accommodate posters and videos for each accepted submission which you can access via the menu on the top-right in the Openreview forum of your paper. **The deadline for uploading videos and posters is 23:59 GMT on November 1st, 2024.**

## Oral presentations

Please prepare your presentations following these guidelines: 
* Each talk will be assigned to a specific Oral session (program details sent separately) 
* We are allocating 15 minutes for each talk: 12 min for the presentation + 3 min for Q&A
* All speakers for an oral session must make themselves known to the session chair at least 10 minutes BEFORE the session begins, as well as to try out connections. At 5-minutes before, the chair will likely drop the paper for no-show authors from the session.
