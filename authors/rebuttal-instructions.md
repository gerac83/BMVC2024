**Reviews Released to Authors: 14th July 2023**

**Rebuttal Due: 23:59 UK Time 21st July 2023**


After receiving the reviews, the authors may optionally submit a rebuttal to address the reviewers' comments, which will be limited to `a one-page PDF` file using the [rebuttal template](https://www.bmvc2023.org/files/bmvc_rebuttal.zip), **or** `4000 characters` if authors choose to submit the rebuttal using the provided text box.

The rebuttal must maintain anonymity and cannot include external links that reveal the author's identity or circumvent the length restriction. 

Responses longer than one page (or 4000 characters if using the text box) will simply not be reviewed. This includes responses where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those specified by the style guide. 

The author rebuttal is optional and is meant to provide you with an opportunity to rebut factual errors or to supply the additional information requested by the reviewers. It is NOT intended to add new contributions (theorems, algorithms, experiments) that were absent in the original submission and NOT specifically requested by the reviewers. You may optionally add a figure, graph, or proof to your rebuttal to better illustrate your answer to the reviewers' comments.
 
Reviewers should refrain from requesting significant additional experiments for the rebuttal, or penalize for lack of additional experiments. Authors should refrain from including new experimental results in the rebuttal, especially when not specifically requested to do so by the reviewers.
