This reliance often overshadows the true potential of deep learning, significantly impacting their performance and robustness in diverse scenarios. Particularly, shortcuts embedded in training data may prove detrimental in testing scenarios, acting as sources of interference rather than assistance. A notable challenge arises in biased datasets, where the learning of the intended attribute is hindered by spurious correlations with extraneous attributes.
This paper introduces an innovative method that harnesses positive feedback to foster internal differentiation within the model, thereby diminishing feature entanglement and enhancing the learning of distinct, non-shortcut features. Our approach employs model parameter masks to segment the model into locally specialized subcomponents. This segmentation facilitates the amplification of differences between these components through interaction, allowing for the distribution of the model's overall functionality across each subcomponent. In essence, our method enables the independent learning of diverse features, circumventing the model's reliance on shortcut features.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of datasets from multiple perspectives have demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed method. It significantly enriches feature diversity and improves model performance in complex scenarios.<br><br><h2>Video</h2><center><iframe height="540" width="960" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" src="https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2024/papers/Paper_736/video.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Niu_2024_BMVC,
