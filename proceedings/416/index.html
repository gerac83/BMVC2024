Traditional loss functions such as cross-entropy and binary cross-entropy are often inadequate due to their inability to address the imbalances between the classes with high representation and the classes with low representation found in medical image datasets. We introduce a novel polynomial loss function based on PadÃ© approximation, designed specifically to overcome the challenges associated with long-tailed classification. This approach incorporates asymmetric sampling techniques to better classify under-represented classes. We conducted extensive evaluations on three publicly available medical datasets and a proprietary medical dataset. Our implementation of the proposed loss function is open-sourced in the public repository: https://github.com/ipankhi/ALPA.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Kashyap_2024_BMVC,
