Previous semi-supervised approaches incorporating contrastive learning relied on unlabeled samples to apply the contrastive learning method. Consequently, to identify positive samples from unlabeled ones, they needed to make pseudo-labels, but inaccurate pseudo-labels lead to confirmation bias toward majority classes in long-tail datasets. Therefore, we want to obtain meaningful information from labeled samples which include accurate labels. In this paper, we introduce Seperated Independent Contrastive Semi-Supervised Learning (SICSSL) for long-tail, which leverages a supervised contrastive learning approach for labeled samples and unlabeled samples separately and independently to enhance performance. In our experiments, employing labeled samples for contrastive learning yields superior performance compared to the contrastive learning using only unlabeled samples.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Kim_2024_BMVC,
