However, radiance fields often implicitly model the 3D geometry, making direct manipulation challenging for users. Current editing methods often rely on customized NeRFs or employ ray bending, which lacks universality. To address these issues, we propose DRAFT, a novel editing system that translates user edits directly into implicit representations, bypassing the need for ray bending or customized labeling. DRAFT focuses on voxel-based radiance fields, mapping user edits to the latent space defined on the voxel representation. By modeling user edits as two steps - \textit{Selection} and \textit{Modification} - we implement various composable editing operations, including standard operations such as copy-and-paste, rotation, stretching, and removal. Additionally, for more realistic scene editing purposes, we introduce a stamp operation to address the artifacts caused by editing and seam carving on radiance fields to achieve content-aware resizing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRAFT produces realistic editing results for both synthetic and real-world scenes.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Cai_2024_BMVC,
