For this issue, we propose a novel approach to knowledge distillation in lightweight human pose estimation. In previous knowledge distillation methods, the strategies in the cross-stage distillation distillation overlooked semantic mismatches caused by the differing complexities of teacher and student networks, potentially leading to negative regularization. To address this issue, we propose a novel method based on the cross-stage knowledge distillation framework. In the cross-stage knowledge distillation process, we transform student features in different stages through multiple receptive field feature transformations, by expanding the receptive fields of student features to better align them to the receptive fields of teacher features. We compute the similarity matrix between student and teacher features. By associating the features of both, we obtain cross-attention weights to facilitate effective cross-layer distillation interaction. At the output stage of the model, we replace the heatmap-based keypoint representation method with a classification coordinate-based approach, reducing the inference memory by 20\% and speeding up inference time. Additionally, the vanilla knowledge distillation is performed on the output horizontal and vertical coordinates. Extensive experiments on the MPII and COCO datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Xu_2024_BMVC,
