However, many existing Causal Representation Learning (CRL) methods are hindered by strong assumptions, such as full data annotation, the need for counterfactual data, and/or prior knowledge of the causal structure. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal-Macro, a weakly supervised architecture that effectively discovers semantic causal factors and learns their causal relations. We theoretically show that Causal-Macro is identifiable in the sense that the marginalized posterior distribution of learned factors can be identified up to coordinate-wise reparameterization of ground-truth factors. In addition, we show that existing CRL datasets are limited to simple causal graphs with a small number of generative factors. Thus, we propose two new datasets with a larger number of diverse generative factors and more sophisticated causal graphs. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of Causal-Macro over existing methods, supported by detailed studies highlighting the impact of each design element in Causal-Macro.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Zhu_2024_BMVC,
