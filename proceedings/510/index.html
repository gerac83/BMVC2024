Therefore, it is crucial to investigate intelligent monitoring technologies that can accurately recognize sitting postures in real-time. However, most of the previous studies in this field have focused on a single spatial or temporal domain, and these methods do not yield full information. In this paper, we propose a system called ML-2SN. In that system, we use LSTM to capture the latent temporal features in a set of consecutive skeletal key points as the temporal domain features of the model. We use MobileNetV3 to learn the connections among skeletal key points in the black background image of the skeleton as the spatial features of the model. To enhance the model's attention to action changes, we design the Mapping Block to attenuate the influence of spatial features on the model. Additionally, the ResLSTM Block is designed to enhance the effect of temporal features on the model. During model training, we use a novel label smoothing method (Action Label Smoothing) to attenuate the effect of action boundaries on the model. The system improves accuracy by recognizing human joints and filtering out ambient noise, effectively reducing the model's reference time. The experimental results show that the average detection accuracy of the system is 0.8894, which is 0.0192 better than the best existing method.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Jia_2024_BMVC,
