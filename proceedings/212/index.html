Domain generalization (DG) solves this issue by learning representations independent of domain-related information, thus facilitating extrapolation to unseen environments. Existing approaches typically focus on formulating tailored training objectives to extract shared features from the source data. However, the disjointed training and testing procedures may compromise robustness, particularly in the face of unforeseen variations during deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel and holistic framework based on causality, named Mixstyle-Entropy, designed to enhance model generalization by incorporating causal intervention during training and causal perturbation during testing. Specifically, during the training phase, we employ entropy-based causal intervention (EnIn) to refine the selection of causal variables. To identify samples with anti-interference causal variables from the target domain, we propose a novel metric, homeostatic score, through causal perturbation (HoPer) to construct a prototype classifier in test time. Experimental results across multiple cross-domain tasks confirm the efficacy of Mixstyle-Entropy.<br><br><h2>Video</h2><center><iframe height="540" width="960" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" src="https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2024/papers/Paper_212/video.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Tang_2024_BMVC,
