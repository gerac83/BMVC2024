To evaluate the categorization ability of visual AI models, various proxy tasks on recognition from datasets to open world scenarios have been proposed. Recent development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has demonstrated impressive results in high-level visual tasks, such as visual question answering, video temporal reasoning, etc., utilizing the advanced architectures and large-scale multimodal instruction tuning. Previous researchers have developed holistic benchmarks to measure the high-level visual capability of LMMs, but there is still a lack of pure and in-depth quantitative evaluation of the most fundamental categorization ability. According to the research on human cognitive process, categorization can be seen as including two parts: category learning and category use. Inspired by this, we propose a novel, challenging, and efficient benchmark based on composite blocks, called **ComBo**, which provides a disentangled evaluation framework and covers the entire categorization process from learning to use. By analyzing the results of multiple evaluation tasks, we find that although LMMs exhibit acceptable generalization ability in learning new categories, there are still gaps compared to humans in many ways, such as fine-grained perception of spatial relationship and abstract category understanding. Through the study of categorization, we can provide inspiration for the further development of LMMs in terms of interpretability and generalization.<br><br><h2>Video</h2><center><iframe height="540" width="960" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" src="https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2024/papers/Paper_887/video.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Fu_2024_BMVC,
