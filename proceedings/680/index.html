To address this issue, most approaches in Continual Learning (CL) rely on the replay of a restricted buffer of past data. However, the presence of noise in real-world scenarios, where human annotation is constrained by time limitations or where data is automatically gathered from the web, frequently renders these strategies vulnerable. In this study, we address the problem of CL under Noisy Labels (CLN) by introducing Alternate Experience Replay (AER), which *takes advantage of forgetting* to maintain a clear distinction between clean, complex, and noisy samples in the memory buffer. The idea is that complex or mislabeled examples, which hardly fit the previously learned data distribution, are most likely to be forgotten. To grasp the benefits of such a separation, we equip AER with Asymmetric Balanced Sampling (ABS): a new sample selection strategy that prioritizes purity on the current task while retaining relevant samples from the past. Through extensive computational comparisons, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and purity of the obtained buffer, resulting in a remarkable average gain of $4.71$% points in accuracy with respect to existing loss-based purification strategies.
