Recently, there has been a growing interest in multi-modal learning for uncovering novel insights not available through uni-modal datasets alone. By combining cardiac magnetic resonance images, electrocardiogram signals, and available medical information, our approach enables the capture of holistic status about individuals' cardiovascular health by leveraging shared information across modalities. Integrating information from multiple modalities and benefiting from self-supervised learning techniques, our model provides a comprehensive framework for enhancing cardiovascular disease prediction with limited annotated datasets.

We employ a masked autoencoder to pre-train the electrocardiogram ECG encoder, enabling it to extract relevant features from raw electrocardiogram data, and an image encoder to extract relevant features from cardiac magnetic resonance images. Subsequently, we utilize a multi-modal contrastive learning objective to transfer knowledge from expensive and complex modality, cardiac magnetic resonance image, to cheap and simple modalities such as electrocardiograms and medical information. Finally, we fine-tuned the pre-trained encoders on specific predictive tasks, such as myocardial infarction. Our proposed method enhanced the image information by leveraging different available modalities and outperformed the supervised approach by 7.6% in balanced accuracy.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Girlanda_2024_BMVC,
