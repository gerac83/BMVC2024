However, it may fall short in capturing long-range dependencies and relationships between distant tokens. Additionally, we find that learning on spatial domain does not convey the frequency content of the image, which is a crucial aspect in SISR. To tackle these issues, we propose a new Channel-Partitioned Attention Transformer (CPAT) to better capture long-range dependencies by sequentially expanding windows along the height and width of feature maps. In addition, we propose a novel Spatial-Frequency Interaction Module (SFIM), which incorporates information from spatial and frequency domains to provide a more comprehensive information from feature maps. This includes information about the frequency content and enhances the receptive field across the entire image. Experimental findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules and architecture. In particular, CPAT surpasses current state-of-the-art methods HAT by up to 0.31dB at x2 SR on Urban100.<br><br><h2>Video</h2><center><iframe height="540" width="960" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" src="https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2024/papers/Paper_432/video.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Tran_2024_BMVC,
