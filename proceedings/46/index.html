Traditional approaches leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of medical image segmentation. However, inherent limitations persist: CNN-based methods often neglect long-range dependencies, and Transformer-based methods may overlook local context information. Moreover, in contrast to natural images, medical images present a distinct challenge wherein the foreground targets requiring segmentation are typically smaller, accompanied by a greater abundance of background information (considered as irrelevant information). This inherent characteristic often interferes with segmentation networks and leads to segmentation results that may lack the desired refinement. To overcome these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Filter Module (FFM) designed to discern between informative and non-informative features. These features seamlessly transition into our proposed Feature Refinement Module (FRM), assigning them distinct roles to establish a robust connection between the two input features. This strategy empowers our module to concurrently focus on both long-range dependencies and local context information by skillfully merging convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by integrating our proposed FFM and FRM into the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework named Feature Filter-Refinement UNet (FFR-UNet). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of FFR-UNet, consistently achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.
