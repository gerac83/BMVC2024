Therefore, Handwritten Chinese Character Error Correction (HCCEC) cannot be simply framed as a classification problem, but should be expressed as an open vocabulary question without predefined categories. Beyond visual information, Chinese characters also carry semantic information such as structure and components, which can be represented as Ideographic Description Sequences (IDS). To harness multiple modalities effectively, we adopt a human-inspired approach to error identification, discerning differences in components and structures between erroneous and correct characters. Accordingly, we propose a multi-modal encoder-decoder network incorporating CLIP training methodology. Through pre-training similar to CLIP, the model aligns handwritten characters with their corresponding IDS. The multi-modal decoder deciphers features combining image and semantic information, outputting IDS. With the output IDS, identifying and correcting errors becomes straightforward. The experimental results indicate that our method, as an approach not reliant on pre-defined categories, achieves performance comparable to that of closed-set classification methods with pre-defined categories in the HCCEC task.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Sun_2024_BMVC,
