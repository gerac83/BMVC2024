In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach that boosts MAE performance by integrating pseudo labelling for both class and data tokens, alongside replacing the traditional pixel-level reconstruction with token-level reconstruction. This strategy uses cluster assignments as pseudo labels to promote instance-level discrimination within the network, while token reconstruction requires generation of discrete tokens encapturing local context. The targets for pseudo labelling and reconstruction needs to be generated by a teacher network. 
To disentangle the generation of target pseudo labels and the reconstruction of the token features, we decouple the teacher into two distinct models, where one serves as a labelling teacher and the other as a reconstruction teacher. This separation proves empirically superior to a single teacher, while having negligible impact on throughput and memory consumption. Incorporating pseudo-labelling as an auxiliary task has demonstrated notable improvements in ImageNet-1K and other downstream tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, and detection.<br><br><h2>Video</h2><center><iframe height="540" width="960" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" src="https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2024/papers/Paper_737/video.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Nandam_2024_BMVC,
