Recent work suggests that these models can assign undesirably high likelihood to out-of-distribution data, questioning their reliability for applications where likelihoods are important (e.g. outlier detection). We show that continuous normalising flows trained with the conditional flow matching objective, instead of maximum likelihood, also provide unreliable likelihoods. We then argue for and investigate the utility of incorporating multimodality in the base distribution, through a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) centred at the empirical means of a target distributionâ€™s modes. The GMM has an additional benefit in that samples can be generated from specified modes. We find that the GMM base distribution leads to performance comparable to a standard (unimodal) base distribution for in- and out-of-distribution likelihoods, at little to no extra cost in training and inference times. Interestingly, samples generated by models that use a GMM base have higher precision but significantly lower recall compared to the standard base. We also find support for the hypothesis that continuous flows depend too strongly on pixel values, rather than semantic content.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Josias_2024_BMVC,
