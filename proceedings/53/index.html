Traditional optimization-based methods are slow, prompting the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, such as VoxelMorph and Transformer-based strategies, for faster results. However, these DL methods often impose significant resource demands.
In response to these challenges, we present NCA-Morph, an innovative approach that seamlessly blends DL with a bio-inspired communication and networking approach, enabled by Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs). NCA-Morph not only harnesses the power of DL for efficient image registration but also builds a network of local communications between cells and respective voxels over time, mimicking the interaction observed in living systems.
In our extensive experiments, we subject NCA-Morph to evaluations across three distinct 3D registration tasks, encompassing Brain, Prostate and Hippocampus images from both healthy and diseased patients. The results showcase NCA-Morph's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, NCA-Morph distinguishes itself as a lightweight architecture with significantly fewer parameters -- 60% and 99.7% less -- than VoxelMorph and TransMorph. This characteristic positions NCA-Morph as an ideal solution for resource-constrained medical applications, such as primary care settings and operating rooms.<br><br><h2>Video</h2><center><iframe height="540" width="960" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" src="https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2024/papers/Paper_53/video.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Ranem_2024_BMVC,
