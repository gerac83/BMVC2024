Recent advancements in neural rendering have facilitated the rapid development of methods capable of rendering new trajectories. However, these methods often fail to generalize well to regions far from the training data without an optimized flight path, leading to suboptimal reconstructions. We propose a self-supervised cyclic neural-analytic pipeline that combines high-quality neural rendering outputs with precise geometric insights from analytical methods. Our solution enhances both RGB and mesh reconstructions for novel view synthesis, particularly in undersampled areas and regions entirely distinct from the training dataset. We leverage an effective transformer-based architecture for image reconstruction to refine and adapt the synthesis process, enabling effective handling of novel, unseen poses without relying on extensive labeled datasets. Our findings demonstrate substantial improvements in rendering views of novel and also 3D reconstruction, which to the best of our knowledge is a first, setting a new standard for autonomous navigation in complex outdoor environments. To foster further research and application, we will make our code publicly available.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Costea_2024_BMVC,
