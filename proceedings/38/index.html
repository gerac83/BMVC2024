However, such a model often learns
not only the information that is truly useful for classification, but also group attributes
that are spuriously correlated with classes, leading to misclassification of an image into
a group with the same group attributes but with the wrong class. The goal of this paper is to develop a method for learning a classifier that is robust to the group attributes.
Unlike existing methods, our method is (i) knowledge-free: does not use any information of group attributes for training, (ii) linear: a lightweight method that trains only a
single linear projection, and (iii) calibration-based: does not change the original classifier at all. The negative effects of the group attributes can be canceled by projecting the
classification space to the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by the group
attributes. To achieve this, we propose Spurious Subspace Mining (SSM) to discover the
subspace from a random set of text embeddings without any supervision. Experimental
results on two standard benchmark datasets, Waterbirds and CelebA, show that the proposed method outperforms various existing methods and improves zero-shot baseline by
35.2% in worst-group accuracy.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Ishizaki_2024_BMVC,
