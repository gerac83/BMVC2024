Herein, we present a Retinex-inspired cooperative game based image restoration technique termed \textbf{RICG} to address the difficulty of navigating model performance and efficiency in different kinds of environments within a unified model. Specifically, we propose a two-step pipeline, comprising self-supervised illumination disentanglement and adjustment. The zero-shot illumination disentanglement is trained through a novel camera response Transformer (CRT), followed by illumination adjustment using a dual-discriminator feature pyramid network (DDFPN) incorporating an self-attention regularization. It is worth mentioning that we devise a specialized training process to reconstruct the optimal restored image through cooperative game. We substantiate the diverse advantages of RICG over existing methods through a meticulous and comprehensive evaluation process, illustrating its versatility in unexplored and convoluted circumstances.
