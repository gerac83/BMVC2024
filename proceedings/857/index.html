Recently, there has been growing interest in using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for this purpose, due to their proficiency in learning effectively from the limited examples typical in specialized fields like radiology. Traditionally, radiologists generate reports by scrutinizing specific regions of an x-ray for changes, which are then systematically described with references to anatomical structures in the reportâ€™s text. Existing methodologies, however, often process the radiographic image as a whole, which requires the fine-grained alignment to be learnt during the training phase through predominantly global optimization objectives. During pretraining this approach overlooks the subtleties of local image-to-text correspondences which results in automatically generated reports that are deficient in critical grounding elements, subsequently impeding the explanation of model predictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset of interleaved radiology images with locally aligned phrase grounding annotations provided by radiologists. Drawing on grounding techniques employed in general-domain MLLMs, our methodology introduces learnable location tokens to enhance understanding of spatial relationships for model. We structure our training samples as sequences that encompass entire x-ray images, corresponding report texts, and region anchors. The
region anchors are defined as sequences composed of the aforementioned location tokens to denote specific anatomical areas of interest. Combined with a grounding prompttuning strategy, this dataset fosters a direct connection between the radiology reportâ€™s text
and specific regions of the x-ray image. Our evaluation, conducted on large-scale public
datasets, demonstrates that our proposed approach significantly refines the capabilities of
existing MLLMs for radiology report generation.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Santiesteban_2024_BMVC,
