Therefore, we propose a key instances based spatio-temporal reasoning model. The proposed key instance identification module can identify key roles and key frames from video sequences, and dynamically aggregate the features of related actors through a graph relationship reasoning model. Joint features and RGB features are extracted from the video sequence, and the two are fused through the proposed multi-modal fusion TCT module, which enhances the expressive ability of the original features. In order to infer group activity through spatio-temporal correlation, the improved cross-transformer module is further used to perform spatio-temporal synchronic reasoning on group activity from two dimensions: time and space. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high accuracy on two public general data sets, and outperforms most of state-of-the-art methods.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{He_2024_BMVC,
