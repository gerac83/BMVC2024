Most previous methods primarily experiment with the NYUv2 Dataset and concentrate on the overall performance in their evaluation. 
However, their robustness and generalization to diversely unseen types or categories for indoor spaces (spaces types) have yet to be discovered. Researchers may empirically find degraded performance in a released pretrained model on custom data or less-frequent types. 
This paper studies the common but easily overlooked factor- space type and realizes a model's performance variances across spaces. 
We present InSpaceType Dataset, a high-quality RGBD dataset for general indoor scenes, and benchmark 13 recent state-of-the-art methods on InSpaceType. 
Our examination shows that most of them suffer from performance imbalance between head and tailed types, and some top methods are even more severe. 
The work reveals and analyzes underlying bias in detail for transparency and robustness. 
We extend the analysis to a total of 4 datasets and discuss the best practice in synthetic data curation for training indoor monocular depth. Further, dataset ablation is conducted to find out the key factor in generalization.
This work marks the first in-depth investigation of performance variances across space types and, more importantly, releases useful tools, including datasets and codes, to closely examine your pretrained depth models.
