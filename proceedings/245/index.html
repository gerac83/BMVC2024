Recently, more attention has been given to dense regression methods for this task. These methods offer a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency through the densely regressing hand joint offset maps. Despite the benefits, large-scale regression offset values are often affected by noise and outliers, leading to a significant drop in accuracy. To address this issue, we re-formulate 3D hand pose estimation as a dense ordinal regression problem and introduced a new Dense Ordinal Regression 3D Pose Network (DOR3D-Net). Specifically, we first decompose offset value regression into sub-tasks of binary classifications with ordinal constraints. Then, each binary classifier can predict the probability of a binary spatial relationship relative to joint, which is easier to train and yield much lower level of noise. The estimated hand joint positions are inferred by aggregating the ordinal regression results at local positions with a weighted sum. Furthermore, both joint regression loss and ordinal regression loss are used to train our DOR3D-Net in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on public datasets (ICVL, MSRA, NYU and HANDS2017) show that our design provides significant improvements over SOTA methods.<br><br><h2>Video</h2><center><iframe height="540" width="960" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" src="https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2024/papers/Paper_245/video.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Mao_2024_BMVC,
