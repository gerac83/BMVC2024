Therefore, the performance of the hashing network is completely oriented from the clustering algorithm, so there is no way to overcome inaccurate clustering results. To address this issue, we introduce a hyper-quantization tree method that regularizes erroneous clustering results for training robust unsupervised hashing networks. The proposed method employs a tree structure that forces leaf nodes to merge into two clusters. We refer to this forced merging method as hyper-quantization, and the merged binary cluster is used as pseudo labels that overcome the erroneous clustering results. With this hyper-quantization, we train each bit of the hash code, allowing each bit to learn a diverse feature space. As a result, our hashing network performs better due to the accurate and diversified feature representation. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed hyper-quantization tree greatly enhances the performance of the state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing networks. We also provide in-depth analyses to support our claims on the diversified feature representation.
