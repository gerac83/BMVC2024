A significant challenge in SLR arises from its weakly supervised nature, where each entire video is annotated with a sequence of glosses. This makes it particularly difficult to accurately identify the corresponding gloss for specific video segments. To address this challenge, we present SignVTCL, a multi-modal continuous sign language recognition framework enhanced by visual-textual contrastive learning, which leverages the full potential of multi-modal data and the generalization ability of language model. First, SignVTCL consolidates multi-modal data to train a unified visual feature extractor, resulting in more robust visual representations. Subsequently, it employs a visual-textual alignment approach that integrates gloss-level and sentence-level alignments, establishing precise correspondences between visual and textual features to enhance SLR accuracy. Experimental results conducted on three datasets, Phoenix-2014, Phoenix-2014T, and CSL-Daily, demonstrate that SignVTCL achieves state-of-the-art results compared with previous methods.
