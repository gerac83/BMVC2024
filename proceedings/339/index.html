This necessitates the timely identification of authentic content. However, most advanced detection methods are computationally heavy, hindering their real-time application. In this paper, we describe an efficient two-stream architecture for real-time image manipulation detection. Our method consists of two-stream branches targeting the cognitive and inspective perspectives. In the cognitive branch, we propose efficient wavelet-guided Transformer blocks to capture the global manipulation traces related to frequency. This block contains an interactive wavelet-guided self-attention module that integrates wavelet transformation with efficient attention design, interacting with the knowledge from the inspective branch. The inspective branch consists of simple convolutions that capture fine-grained traces and interact bidirectionally with Transformer blocks to provide mutual support. Our method is lightweight (âˆ¼ 8M) but achieves competitive performance compared to many other counterparts, demonstrating its efficacy in image manipulation detection and its potential for portable integration.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{zhangyangxiang_2024_BMVC,
