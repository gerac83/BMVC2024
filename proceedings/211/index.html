Despite its notable advancements, this paper identifies two key forms of misalignment within the model: classification-regression misalignment and cross-layer target misalignment. 
Both issues impede DETR's convergence and degrade its overall performance.
To  tackles both issues simultaneously, we introduce a novel loss function, termed as  Align Loss, designed to resolve the discrepancy between the two tasks.
Align Loss guides the optimization of DETR through a joint quality metric, strengthening the connection between classification and regression. 
Furthermore, it incorporates an exponential down-weighting term to facilitate a smooth transition from positive to negative samples. 
Align-DETR also employs many-to-one matching for supervision of intermediate layers, akin to the design of  $\mathcal{H}$-DETR , which enhances robustness against instability.
We conducted extensive experiments, yielding highly competitive results. Notably, our method achieves a $49.3\%~(+0.6)$ AP on the $\mathcal{H}$-DETR baseline with the ResNet-50 backbone. It also sets a new state-of-the-art performance, reaching $50.5\%$ AP in the 1$\times$ setting and $51.7\%$ AP in the 2$\times$ setting, surpassing several strong competitors.
