Existing pan-sharpening methods have two main issues. Firstly, deep learning-based methods are mostly designed based on black-box principles, lacking sufficient interpretability. Secondly, model-based methods enhance interpretability but do not fully consider domain-specific prior knowledge, namely complex spatial and spectral relationships, which limits their performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep unfolding network with spatial-spectral perception enhanced for pan-sharpening, namely SSPEDUN. Specifically, we model the pan-sharpening problem as the minimization of a variational model with spatial reconstruction priors and spectral modulation priors. The spatial reconstruction prior reconstructs high-quality spatial information based on observed image spatial relationships, while the spectral modulation prior accurately modulates the spectral relationships between images. Then, we design an efficient iterative proximal gradient descent algorithm to alternately solve the data subproblem and the prior subproblem of the model, and then unfold this algorithm into a deep network. In the deep unfolding network, we introduce a data projection module to address data mapping during the optimization process and carefully design a Perception Enhancement Module (PEM) as the prior module to precisely model spatial and spectral relationships. Extensive experiments on three satellite datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.
