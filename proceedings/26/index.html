Recent progress with Transformer models has demonstrated notable advantages over conventional CNNs in this area. However, there's still a gap in understanding how these models prioritize different regions in 2D images and how these regions affect depth estimation performance. To explore the differences between Transformers and CNNs, we employ a sparse pixel approach to contrastively analyze the distinctions between the two. Our findings suggest that while Transformers excel in handling global context and intricate textures, they lag behind CNNs in preserving depth gradient continuity. To further enhance the performance of Transformer models in monocular depth estimation, we propose the Depth Gradient Refinement (DGR) module that refines depth estimation through high-order differentiation, feature fusion, and recalibration. Additionally, we leverage optimal transport theory, treating depth maps as spatial probability distributions, and employ the optimal transport distance as a loss function to optimize our model. Experimental results demonstrate that models integrated with the plug-and-play Depth Gradient Refinement (DGR) module and the proposed loss function enhance performance without increasing complexity and computational costs on both outdoor KITTI and indoor NYU-Depth-v2 datasets. This research not only offers fresh insights into the distinctions between Transformers and CNNs in depth estimation but also paves the way for novel depth estimation methodologies.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Yao_2024_BMVC,
