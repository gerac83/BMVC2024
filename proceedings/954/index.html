This is particularly true for facial data, given growing privacy concerns and the need for rapid development in face recognition systems. However, synthetic facial data often derives from existing datasets, raising privacy issues as synthesizers may inadvertently expose real training data. Our method is motivated to address this important aspect. In this paper, we develop a model that provides a probabilistic score indicating how likely a synthetic face incorporates elements from the training dataset. We focus on facial traits â€” eyes, nose, mouth and their fusion â€”modeling training set membership as a probability. This approach allows us to assess whether a synthesizer captures training set characteristics too closely. In addition to generating whole synthetic faces, we explore the generative models' latent space by creating variations in specific facial traits, to more thoroughly assess whether the synthesizer overly relies on facial features from the training set. This method provides a deeper understanding of the synthesizer's tendency to reproduce learned characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that we can establish boundaries for determining full or partial presence of a sample in the training set, depending on specific facial traits. We also found that combining multiple facial traits in our model improves accuracy. The resulting privacy score indicates how much a synthetic dataset contains identifiable features from its training data, effectively measuring its level of compromise. In summary, our results show that by analyzing individual facial features, we can assess how well a synthetic face dataset preserves privacy, relative to the real dataset used to train its synthesizer.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Leyva_2024_BMVC,
