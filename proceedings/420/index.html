Scene graph to image generation is one such task of generating images which are consistent with the given scene graph. However, the complexity of visual scenes poses a challenge in accurately aligning objects based on specified relations within the scene graph. Existing methods approach this task by first predicting a scene layout and generating images from these layouts using adversarial training. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to generate images from scene graphs which eliminates the need of predicting intermediate layouts. We leverage pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and CLIP guidance to translate graph knowledge into images. Towards this, we first pre-train our graph encoder to align graph features with CLIP features of corresponding images using a GAN based training. Further, we fuse the graph features with CLIP embedding of object labels present in the given scene graph to create a graph consistent CLIP guided conditioning signal. In the conditioning input, object embeddings provide coarse structure of the image and graph features provide structural alignment based on relationships among objects. Finally, we fine tune a pre-trained diffusion model with the graph consistent conditioning signal with reconstruction and CLIP alignment loss. Elaborate experiments reveal that our method outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks of COCO-stuff and Visual Genome dataset.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{MISHRA_2024_BMVC,
