Recently, transformers have been shown to be extremely effective for this task. However, we identify two issues with the existing transformer-based models. Firstly, they are difficult to adapt to new personalised speaking styles and secondly, they are slow to run for long sentences due to the quadratic complexity of the transformer. We propose TalkLoRA to address both of these issues. TalkLoRA uses Low-Rank Adaptation to effectively and efficiently adapt to new speaking styles, even with limited data. We also utilise a chunking strategy to reduce the complexity of the underlying transformer, allowing for long sentences at inference time. TalkLoRA can be applied to any transformer-based speech-driven animation method. We perform extensive experiments to show that TalkLoRA archives state-of-the-art style adaptation and that it allows for an order-of-complexity reduction in inference times without sacrificing quality. We also investigate and provide insights into the hyperparameter selection for LoRA fine-tuning of speech-driven facial animation models.<br><br><h2>Video</h2><center><iframe height="540" width="960" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" src="https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2024/papers/Paper_34/video.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Saunders_2024_BMVC,
