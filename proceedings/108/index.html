In this paper, we present MoManifold, a novel human motion prior, which models plausible human motion in continuous high-dimensional motion space. Different from existing mathematical or VAE-based methods, our representation is designed based on the neural distance field, which makes human dynamics explicitly quantified to a score and thus can measure human motion plausibility. Specifically, we propose novel decoupled joint acceleration manifolds to model human dynamics from existing limited motion data. Moreover, we introduce a novel optimization method using the manifold distance as guidance, which facilitates a variety of motion-related tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoManifold outperforms existing SOTAs as a prior in several downstream tasks such as denoising real-world human mocap data, recovering human motion from partial 3D observations, mitigating jitters for SMPL-based pose estimators, and refining the results of motion in-betweening.<br><br><h2>Video</h2><center><iframe height="540" width="960" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" src="https://bmva-archive.org.uk/bmvc/2024/papers/Paper_108/video.mp4" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Dang_2024_BMVC,
