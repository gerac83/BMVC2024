There are, however, a small percentage of examples where the process fails due to textureless scenes. In this case, modern VO/SLAM typically relies on finding 2D bifocal feature matches whose corresponding 3D points exist in the map to recover from failure. This is, however, not very helpful, as ruling out 2D feature matches whose corresponding 3D points do not exist leaves only minor amount of matches available for pose estimation, a catastrophic situation when the texture is already insufficient in images. 
This paper proposes integrating modern VO/SLAM with trifocal pose estimation for resolving tracking failure. By acquiring two history images from the covisible graph in conjunction with the current image, trifocal poses can be found from triplet 2D oriented point matches, {\em e.g.}, SIFT or ORB, where one is associated with a 3D point in space.
In addition, existing trifocal pose estimation solver are computationally too expensive to be used in a practical setting, particularly under a RANSAC scheme for robust estimation. This paper thus propose an enhanced GPU-based homotopy continuation solver (GPU-HC), called GPU-HC++, whose performance is significantly improved over GPU-HC. 
We show that integrating PLP-SLAM and ORB-SLAM3 with the proposed approach on challenging sequences of TUM-RGBD and EuRoC datasets substantially increases the success rate of tracking failure recovery without the cost of losing significant runtime.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Chien_2024_BMVC,
