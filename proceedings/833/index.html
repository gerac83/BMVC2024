A typical conventional method called PaDiM pre-trains convolutional neural networks with the ImageNet dataset for 1000-class classification and detects the anomaly images from deviance on the feature space. However, since a single class in ImageNet has a wide range of meanings, it is difficult to represent subtle difference between normal and anomaly images as different features. Moreover, PaDiM assumes that two images with similar anomaly scores have features with similar values. However, the feature space is made to classify the ImageNet class, it is not designed to assign two images with similar anomaly scores to relatively similar features. Therefore, we propose an anomaly detection method based on pre-training using novely semi-formula driven image dataset to represent â€œsubtle differenceâ€ between two images as different features and two images with similar â€œanomaly scoreâ€ as similar features. An image dataset for pre-training is generated by adding pseudo-defects with random Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters to an existing image dataset. GMM parameters have a different value for each parameter, but the appearances of the generated images have only subtle difference. Next, the regression network is pre-trained to estimate GMM parameters that represent the anomaly score of generated anomaly images. In the experiments with MVTecAD, the proposed method achieved high precision anomaly detection for categories where ImageNet performed poorly.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Kobayashi_2024_BMVC,
