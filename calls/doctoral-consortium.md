We are delighted to invite submissions for the Doctoral Consortium at the upcoming <a href="https://bmvc2024.org">British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC)</a>, to take place on 25-28 November, 2024 in Glasgow, Scotland, UK. The Doctoral Consortium will provide a unique opportunity for PhD students who are within 6 months (before or after) of graduating with their doctoral degree to interact with experienced researchers in computer vision. Each student will be assigned a mentor who is a senior member of the community attending the conference, based on similarity of research interests. Students and mentors will attend the Doctoral Consortium event in person, giving students an opportunity to discuss their ongoing research and career plans with their mentor.

We invite submissions from PhD students conducting research in any area of computer vision. Each student will be given a 10-minute slot to present their ongoing research followed by a short Q&A session and then will have the opportunity to present a poster on their research within the main BMVC poster session. The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to help students to refine their research ideas and to receive feedback on their work in progress. Additionally, this year, there will also be an academic speaker and an industrial speaker talking about the future career prospects for students.

Submissions should consist of:

- A (maximum) two-page abstract of the research the student will be presenting at the Doctoral Consortium.
- The student’s CV.
- A letter from the student’s supervisor confirming their date of graduation.

Submission Guidelines:

- Abstracts should describe the research that the student wishes to present and may include already published work.
- The abstract submission should be formatted according to the BMVC template, available on the conference website.
- Submission to the Doctoral Consortium while also presenting a paper at the main conference is permitted.
- **The submission deadline is Wednesday 31st July (23:59 GMT).**

**Submission for the Doctoral Consortium should be sent to <doctoral.consortium@bmvc2024.org>.**

Selection Process: Submissions will be reviewed by a panel of experts in computer vision. Selection will be based on the quality and potential impact of the research, as well as the clarity and organisation of the abstract.

Accepted authors will be invited to attend the Doctoral Consortium in parallel to the main track of BMVC. Each student will give a short presentation, followed by a Q&A session with the panel and other attendees. After the oral presentations, there will be two presentations on the future career prospects for students, one of which will be given by an academic speaker and another by an industrial speaker.  Students will then present a poster within the main BMVC poster session. Each student will additionally have the opportunity to receive individual feedback from their assigned mentor.

Important Dates:

- Submission Opens: Sunday, 14th July 2024
- Submission Deadline: Wednesday, 31st July 2024
- Notification of Acceptance: Friday, 6th September 2024
- Doctoral Consortium: TBC, during the main BMVC conference.

All deadlines are 23:59 GMT.

We look forward to receiving your submissions and to a stimulating and productive Doctoral Consortium at BMVC 2024!
