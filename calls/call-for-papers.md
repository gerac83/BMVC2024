The British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) is one of the major international conferences on computer vision and related areas. It is organised by the British Machine Vision Association (BMVA). The 35th BMVC will now be an **in-person** event from 25th—28th November 2024 in Glasgow, UK. 

Authors are invited to submit high-quality papers in image processing, computer vision, machine learning and related areas for BMVC 2024. Submitted papers will be refereed on originality, presentation, empirical results, and evaluation quality. Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings published and DOI-indexed by BMVA. Past proceedings are online at the [BMVA proceedings website](https://britishmachinevisionassociation.github.io/bmvc).

Please note that BMVC is a single-track meeting with oral and poster presentations. **The paper submission deadline will be on the 10th of May 2024**. Submitted papers should not exceed <b>NINE</b> pages (references are excluded), and appendices should be submitted via the supplementary information. You can find further information in the [Author Guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}{% link authors/author-guidelines.md %}) and [Submit your Paper]({{site.baseurl}}{% link authors/submit-your-paper.md %}) pages.

The submission portal will be available from the 2nd of April, 2024.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- 3D from X
- 3D Shape modeling and processing
- Action and event understanding
- Adversarial attack and defense
- Architecture and Space Design
- Biometrics
- Brave new ideas (not beating SOA but a new appraoch, theory, niche)
- Computational Photography and Photogrammetry
- Computer vision theory
- Datasets and Evaluation
- Deep learning architectures and techniques
- Document analysis and understanding
- Embodied vision: Active agents; simulation
- Explainable AI
- Fairness, privacy, ethics, social-good, transparency, accountability in vision
- Generative models
- Humans: Face, Gestures, Pose and Body Movement
- Human-in-the-loop computer vision
- Image Retrieval
- Low-level and Physics-based Vision
- Machine learning (other than deep learning)
- Medical and Biological Image Analysis
- Motion estimation and tracking
- Multimodal learning
- Recognition for X
- Representation Learning
- RGBD sensors and analytics
- Scene Analysis and Understanding
- Segmentation, grouping and shape analysis
- Self-, semi-, meta-, unsupervised learning
- Transfer, low-shot, continual, long-tail learning
- Video analysis and Understanding
- Vision and audio
- Vision and graphics
- Vision and language
- Vision and robotics
- Vision applications and systems
- Visual reasoning and logical representation

Papers submitted under the "Brave new ideas" subject area are expected to move away from incremental benchmark gains. Proposed ideas should radically differ from the current research strand or propose a novel problem.

### Reviewing Process for BMVC 2024

Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. The Area Chair will provide a meta-review, summarising the reviewers' points and recommending paper decisions.

<!-- - The authors will have a period to produce a rebuttal to address the reviewers' points. Authors with papers accepted will need to incorporate reviewers' suggestions before the final camera-ready submission. -->

<!-- - The rebuttal will be handled by only by one Area Chair who will facilitate paper discussion between reviewers and request reviewers to clarify or revise their review. Conflicts will be managed by the ACs and Programme Chairs. -->

**Please Note:** Due to the anticipated volume of papers for BMVC 2024 (based on recent year's experience), there will be NO extension granted to the submission deadline. In keeping with conferences in the field (e.g., [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc), [CVPR](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com)) and to cope with the increasing number of submissions, we ask that all authors be prepared to review papers. **The submission site will ask authors to acknowledge this commitment, and failure to engage with the reviewing process might be grounds for rejection.**

Further information about the reviewing process can be found at the [Reviewing policies]({{site.baseurl}}{% link authors/reviewing-guidelines.md %}).

Any queries to the Programme Chairs should be sent to [programme-chairs@bmvc2024.org](mailto:programme-chairs@bmvc2024.org).
